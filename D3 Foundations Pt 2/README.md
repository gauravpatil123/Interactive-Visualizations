**About**</br>
This directory contains a foundational script for creating bar charts using d3 in javascript, html & css. I have attempted to create four plots using an external open-source dataset about India's GDP growth over years. While creating this plots, I have tried to include a few variations in the bar charts including bar charts with only positive metrics, bar chart with both positive and negetive metrics & horizontal bar chart. While doing this I have also played around with d3 scales(band, linear and color).

**Datasets**</br>
I used the [GDP Growth of India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imbikramsaha/indian-gdp) dataset which I found on Kaggle. It is a open source and relatively simple and clean dataset, which can be directly used to create charts without any data cleaning.

I have also uploaded the same dataset in this directory and you can find it in the [data/GDP Growth of India](https://github.com/gauravpatil123/Interactive-Visualizations/tree/main/D3%20Foundations%20Pt%202/data/GDP%20Growth%20of%20India) directory.

**Scripts**</br>
- India_GDP_Bar_Chart.html</br>
Running this script on a server will create all the charts.

**Outputs**</br>
