  1. Network #1 | Game of Thrones Series Season #1 Hypergraph

**About**</br>
This directory contains a script for creating a hypergraph of Game of Thrones Season #1 The series.

**Datasets**</br>
I have created the hypergraph dataset myself from the dataset published by network of thrones.

The original dataset used to create the hypergraph dataset can be found [here]().

**Scripts**</br>
- got-series-s1-network.html</br>
Running this script on a server will create a hypergraph of all the nodes and edges from the game of thrones season one network dataset. The network graph is interactive with user being able to drag the nodes.

**Outputs**</br>
- Network #1 | Game of Thrones Series Season #1 Hypergraph</br>
